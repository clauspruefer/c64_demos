They told you, "Don't you want to see the pixel matrix here"
"Don't wanna see the surface, you better disappear"
The zooming in the algo and their code are really clear
So zoom it, just zoom it
You better look, you better zoom inside
Don't wanna see no pixel, and don't wanna be a sprite
You wanna be bigger, wanna be magnified
So zoom it, but you wanna be a lense
Just zoom it (zoom it), zoom it (zoom it)
No one wants to be condensed
Showin' how enlarged and outsized is your fight
It doesn't matter who's magnified or 1 pixel bright
Just zoom it (zoom it)
Just zoom it (zoom it)
Just zoom it (zoom it)
Just zoom it (zoom it, uh)
