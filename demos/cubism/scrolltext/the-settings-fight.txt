The Epic Battle of the Jahrhundert: "General Settings" vs. "General Electrics"

General Settings attempts to invoke a devastating attack from its Gnome settings, but alas! His OS is utterly puzzled, frantically searching for the configuration files.
"Are we running Wayland? Perhaps in compatible Xorg mode? Or is it Gnome with KDE settings masquerading as g-settingsd? Try looking inside /home/general/.config... or wait, was it /home/general/.settings? Maybe ~/.local/share? Oh dear..." --> SEGMENTATION FAULT. *BOOM!*

Ah-ha! This is General Electric's golden opportunity! But which car did he use to drive to work today? "Tesla"? Oh noooo! ALSO SEGMENTATION FAULT!
Turns out, using Bluetooth in the slum-zone wasn't the brightest strategic decision. Who knew automotive software could be THIS fragile?

Suddenly, an old general from the GDR appears on the battlefield, calmly observing this magnificent disaster. He casually takes out his trusty Robotron computer - a machine containing only the bare minimum requirements:
One "attack_function()" and one "defend_function()" (both gloriously non-parametrized, of course). BOOM! Both modern Generals eliminated in seconds. Job done. 

The moral of the story? Simplicity wins. Always has. Always will.
