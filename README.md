# c64_demos

Some years ago i was active in the C64-Scene [https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=3003](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=3003).

## Revival

One old crew member is active developer of VICE emulator which primarily emulates C64 on PC.
This made me think about (with PC dev skills in mind) programming some kind of oldshool stuff.

# First Revival Demo

I currently plan a 2 Part Demo consisting of:

- Sine-Movement and Cubes
- Borderless FLD with Rasterbars

## Release Plan

Think about 10 weeks until both parts are finished. This sounds realistic with multiple ongoing projects.
