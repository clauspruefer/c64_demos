### Technical Specs:
```
Geometry:

Texturing:
- Stainless steel beam pipe with panel lines
- Alternating red/blue dipole magnets (32 sections)
- Copper superconducting coils
- Detector sections with sensor grids
- Pulsing energy beam (dynamic brightness)
- Blue cryogenic cooling pipes
- Multi-colored cable trays (6 cable types)
- Equipment terminals with:
  * Beige housing
  * Green/red LED indicators
  * Cyan LCD displays with text effect
  * Dark panel borders for depth

Lighting:
- Three-point lighting system:
  * Key light (top-right, bright)
  * Fill light (left, softer)
  * Rim light (back, depth)
- Enhanced specular highlights
- Shininess: 80 (more metallic)
- Smooth shading

Appearance:
- Realistic accelerator components
- Strong 3D depth from lighting

```

### Terminal Comparison - BEFORE vs AFTER

**BEFORE:**
```
Location: Random spots
Appearance: • (small green point)
Size: Tiny
Detail: None
```

**AFTER:**
```
Location: Every 8th segment (0, 8, 16, 24)
Appearance: Full equipment rack
Size: Occupies ~60% of segment width

### 3D Depth Features Added

**BEFORE:**
- Single flat light
- No depth cues
- Uniform appearance

**AFTER:**
- Three-point lighting creates:
  * Highlights on top surfaces
  * Shadows in recesses
  * Rim lighting for separation
- Thicker geometry emphasizes roundness
- Dark borders on terminals create depth
- Specular highlights on metallic surfaces
- Color variation across surfaces
- Terminals appear to project from surface

### Donut Shape Improvement

**BEFORE:**
- Thin tube (minor radius 0.5)
- Ratio: 2.0/0.5 = 4:1 (very thin)
- Looked more like a ring than a donut

**AFTER:**
- Thick tube (minor radius 0.8)
- Ratio: 2.5/0.8 = 3.125:1 (proper donut)
- Clear donut shape with substantial thickness

## Summary of Changes

| Aspect | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Donut shape | Thin ring | Thick torus | 60% thicker tube |
| Realism | Generic | LHC-style | Actual components |
| Terminals | Green dots | Equipment racks | Full detail |
| 3D depth | Flat | Strong | 3-point lighting |
| Geometry | 2K triangles | 9K triangles | 4.5× smoother |
| Components | 3 patterns | 10+ patterns | Realistic detail |
| Lighting | 1 light | 3 lights | Dramatic depth |

The enhanced version addresses all the original concerns and creates a visually impressive, realistic particle accelerator that clearly shows its 3D donut structure!
