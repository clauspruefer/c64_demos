The fight of the Jahrtausend: "General Settings" vs. "General Electrics"

General Settings tries to invoke an attack from its Gnome settings, but his OS is puzzled dont knowing where to get it from.
"Are we running Wayland? In compatible xorg mode? Or Gnome with KDE settings in g-settingsd ... Try looking inside user /home/general/.config or
was it /home/general/.settings..." -> Segmentation fault.

That is General Electrics chance. Which car used to drive to work? "Tesla"? Oh noooo! Also Segmentation Fault,
using the bluetooth inside the slum-zone wasnt the best idea.

An old general of the GDR appears, watching the fight. He takes out his Robotron computer, only containing the minimum requirements:
"attack function" and "defend function" (non-parametrized). Boom, both Generals eliminated, job done. Simplicity wins.
